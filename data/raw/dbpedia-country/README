Countries network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This folder contains the TSV and related files of the dbpedia-country network:

This is the bipartite network of entities from DBpedia and their affiliated countries. Each edge in the network connects an entity (such as a person) with a country associated with that person. The edges correspond to the <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country> relationships in DBpedia. The countries include former countries, empires and kingdoms as well as disputed country-like entities; therefore, the number of country-nodes is much higher than the number of presently existing countries.

Files: 
    meta.dbpedia-country -- Metadata about the network 
    out.dbpedia-country -- The adjacency matrix of the network in space separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.dbpedia-country are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column: edge weight
